# ES94P:Security Architectures and Network Defence

This repo contains workings of netkit 1.1.4 environment for SAND PMA due on 13th December. Got Distinction Marks :)!

## Phase 1

- [x] 1. satisfy the case-sensitive file-naming requirements of the deliverable files.
- [x] 2. define and implement credible zones of trust.
- [x] 3. define and implement re-organised IP addressing.
- [x] 4. define and implement filters between zones of trust.
- [x] 5. partially verify that connectivity is achieved / prevented as appropriate between clients and services.
- [x] 6. have hashes at the demonstration that match the hashes in the submission sandhashes.sha1 file (ie provide evidence that nothing significant has changed between the submission and the demonstration).

## Phase 2

- [x] 7. implement NAT / port-forwarding.
- [x] 8. robustly verify that connectivity is achieved / prevented as appropriate between clients and services.
- [x] 9. make a compelling case for your design.
- [x] 10. implementation of one augmented feature.

## Phase 3

- [x] 10. implementation of two further significant, distinct, augmented features.
- [x] 11. make a compelling case for your design.
- [x] 12. demonstrate comprehensive mastery of all aspects of the the submission at all scales (detail through to overall concept).
