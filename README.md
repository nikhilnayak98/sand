# ES94P:Security Architectures and Network Defence

This repo contains workings of netkit 1.1.4 environment for SAND PMA due on 13th December.

## Phase 1

1. satisfy the case-sensitive file-naming requirements of the deliverable files.
2. define and implement credible zones of trust.
3. define and implement re-organised IP addressing.
4. define and implement filters between zones of trust.
5. partially verify that connectivity is achieved / prevented as appropriate between clients and services.
6. have hashes at the demonstration that match the hashes in the submission sandhashes.sha1 file (ie provide evidence that nothing significant has changed between the submission and the demonstration).

## Phase 2

7. implement NAT / port-forwarding.
8. robustly verify that connectivity is achieved / prevented as appropriate between clients and services.
9. make a compelling case for your design and implementation of one augmented feature.

## Phase 3

10. make a compelling case for your design and implementation of two further significant, distinct, augmented features.
11. demonstrate comprehensive mastery of all aspects of the the submission at all scales (detail through to overall concept).
